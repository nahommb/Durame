<h2>Cultural Clothes</h2>  
<p>The traditional dress of durame people consists of colorful garments, often made from hand-woven fabrics like cotton or silk.

  Women typically wear a "shinshin," which is a long, loose-fitting dress that falls to the ankles. The Shinshin is often brightly colored and features intricate embroidery or patterns around the sleeves, neckline, and hemline. Women may also wear a "netela," which is a lightweight shawl made from cotton or silk that is draped over the shoulders.
  
  Men traditionally wear a "wudabe," which is a wraparound cloth that is worn around the waist and falls to the knees. The wudabe is typically made from a heavier fabric than women's clothing and may be patterned with stripes or other designs.
  
  Both men and women may also wear a headscarf, particularly during formal occasions or religious ceremonies. Jewelry is also an important part of Kembata culture, and both men and women may wear bracelets, necklaces, and earrings made from beads or other materials.
  <br> <br>
  Overall, durame clothing is known for its bright colors, intricate designs, and use of locally-sourced materials. The clothing is often made by hand and is an important part of the cultural identity of the Kembata people</p>
